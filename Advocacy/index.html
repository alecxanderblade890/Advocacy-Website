      <p class="wow bounceInRight" data-wow-delay=".25s">My name is Alecxander Jamille Andaya and I am 19 years of age. I am aware that I am not a healthy person myself but aspire to be one as soon as possible. You can join me on my journey into tansitioning into a healhty lifestyle and having a physically and mentally fit personality by exploring this webpage. I was once fit and active and was always participating in physical activities like basketball, badminton, and many other sports but due to the pandemic and my lack of interaction with my peers, I got fatter and from 65kg over the year I gained 30kgs which is not very healthy. I have a BMI of 34.9 and on the brink of morbid obesity. Recently I started to do simple and quick exercises to combat my obesity little by little and wish to gain back the healthy body that I once had.</p>

            <p class="card-text">You're undoubtedly aware of your level of fitness. However, measuring and 
			documenting your baseline fitness scores can provide you with standards 
			against which to measure your improvement. 
			<br>
			Consider keeping track of the following to measure your aerobic and muscular fitness, flexibility, and body composition:
			<br>
			1. Your pulse rate before and after walking one mile (1.6 kilometers).
			<br>
			2. How long does it take to walk one mile or how long does it take to run 1.5 miles? (2.41 kilometers).
			<br>
			3. How many conventional or modified pushups can you perform at once?
			<br>
			4. How far forward you can reach while sitting on the floor with your legs in front of you.
			<br>
			5. The circumference of your waist, right above your hipbones.
			<br>
			6. Your BMI (body mass index).</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Design Your Fitness Program</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
            	1. Consider your fitness objectives. Are you embarking on a fitness regimen to help you lose weight? 
				Or are you motivated by something else, such as training for a marathon? Having specific objectives might 
				help you track your progress and stay motivated.
				<br>
				2. Create a balanced routine. For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services 
				recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous 
				aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. The guidelines 
				suggest that you spread out this exercise during the course of a week. Greater amounts of exercise 
				will provide even greater health benefits.
				<br>
				3. Start low and progress slowly. If you're just beginning to exercise, start cautiously and 
				progress slowly. If you have an injury or a medical condition, consult your doctor or an 
				exercise therapist for help designing a fitness program that gradually improves your range 
				of motion, strength and endurance.
				<br>
				4. Build activity into your daily routine. Finding time to exercise can be a challenge. 
				To make it easier, schedule time to exercise as you would any other appointment. Plan to 
				watch your favorite show while walking on the treadmill, read while riding a stationary bike, 
				or take a break to go on a walk at work.
				<br>
				5.  Allow time for recovery. Many people start exercising with frenzied zeal — working 
				out too long or too intensely — and give up when their muscles and joints become sore or 
				injured. Plan time between sessions for your body to rest and recover.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Assemble Your Equipment</h4>
            <p class="card-text">If you're going to buy workout equipment, be sure it's functional, pleasant, and simple to use. 
			Before investing in your own equipment, you may want to test out several types of equipment at a fitness club. 
			Consider fitness applications for smart devices or other activity monitoring gadgets, such as those that 
			can track your mileage, calories burnt, or heart rate.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Get Started</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
            	1. Begin cautiously and progressively increase your workload. Allow enough time to warm up and 
				cool down with moderate walking or mild stretching. Then accelerate to a pace that you can maintain 
				for five to ten minutes without becoming fatigued. Increase the amount of time you workout progressively 
				as your stamina increases. Increase your exercise time to 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week.
				<br>
				2. If necessary, break things up. You don't have to perform all of your workout at once, so spread 
				it out throughout the day. Shorter but more frequent workouts provide similar aerobic effects. Exercising 
				in small bursts many times a day may work better for your schedule than a single 30-minute session. Any 
				level of exercise is preferable to none at all.
				<br>
				3. Pay attention to your body. Take a pause if you experience discomfort, shortness of breath, dizziness, 
				or nausea. You could be overworking yourself.
				<br>
				4. Be adaptable. Give yourself permission to take a day or two off if you're not feeling well.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Take your personal fitness exam again six weeks after you begin your program, and then every few months after that. You may find that in order to continue improving, you need to increase the amount of time you exercise. Or you could be pleasantly pleased to discover that you're exercising just enough to fulfill your fitness objectives. Set new objectives or attempt a new hobby if you lose motivation. Exercising with a buddy or attending a fitness facility class may also be beneficial. Getting started with a fitness regimen is a big step. But it doesn't have to be a huge one. By properly planning and timing yourself, you may create a healthy habit that will last a lifetime.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Develop your own fitness program fit for your goals you want to achieve. Determine your fitness level before setting new goals. It is a good idea to set fitness objectives for yourself that you can achieve throughout your life in order to maintain your fitness level. The more you can set new objectives for yourself and your body, the more likely you are to follow through on them. Some individuals find that competition motivates 
			them to exercise, so you might want to check into local races or charity walks to help keep you motivated to exercise. You will have a single objective in mind while training for these events, which will help you stay on track.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Your fitness level may be exactly where you want it right now. You can run a mile or just keep up with people in your life without any difficulty. But just because you're fit now doesn't imply your body will stay that way in the future. Your fitness level will decline if you do not understand how to maintain it, just as any muscle that is not trained will become weak. I have a very dangerous BMI myself and wish to lower it. I was once fit and active in life but due to the pandemic it was hard for me to be active since I am only motivated to do so in the presence of my peers. I know it is an unhealthy habit, but I recently started to do simple exercise routines that an app provides me with, I know it is not enough to make me lose weight, but it will certainly keep my body active and working properly.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Fitness starts with healthy eating habits and consistent exercises and/or physical activities. You need to keep track of what you eat and count the calories that you take in and count the calories that you burn in doing the exercises. You need to burn more calories than the one that you intake in order to lose weight and be fit, which is my main goal.</p>

During the pandemic, it is hard for us to be motivated to do certain things, but we have to make sure that our health is not neglected in these trying times. I sound like a hypocrite because I am an obese person myself and am extremely unmotivated to do things because of the lack of my peers around me. It is hard to be consistently happy during this time, but I am trying to the best of my ability physically and especially mentally. People my age can benefit from these by being able to know where to start in their fitness journey and I will try to provide them with good and relevant information on the subject at hand. They will be able to assess their fitness level and determine if their body is capable of performing at a good physical level.</p>
